# Glossary

- **ADC**

  Analog Digital Converter

- **AFSK**

  Audio Frequency Shift Keying

- **AMTOR**

  AMateur Teletype Over Radio – ARQ-FAX process developed out of the SITOR process by G3PLX.

- **ANSI**

  American National Standardization Institute. A Terminal-Emulation-Protocol was determined by ANSI, which has been established as a standard for mailbox systems. The ANSI-Terminal Emulation offers cursor control, color support, block graphic and generation of signal tones.

- **ARQ**

  Automatic Request. A procedure to transmit data without errors. If the transmitted data occurs with errors at the receiver, the defect information block will be called from the transceiver once again.

- **ASCII**

  American Standard Code of Information Interchange. 7-bit code for numbers, characters, special characters and control characters.

- **Backup**

  Another word for safety copies, which should be done regularly. Very special (often created with a lot of work) program configurations should be saved regularly too.

- **Baudot Code**

  5-bit code used to transmit characters in RTTY and AMTOR.

- **BIOS**

  Basic Input Output System. The BIOS contains initialization and test programs for the system start as far for the driver (relatively simple) for the peripherals.

- **Boot**

  The whole system start from switching on the system to the moment the system is ready to be used by the operator is called “Boot”.

- **BREAKIN**

  Interrupt. The current receiver is able to interrupt the tansceiver and because of this forces a key transmission.

- **CHANGEOVER**

  Key transmission from the transceiver to the receiver.

- **CPU**

  Central Processing Unit.

- **CSMA**

  Carrier Sense Multiple Access (to the transmission channel). A channel access process used for Packet-Radio, each station by their own has the possibility to decide if the transmission channel is free by carrier recognition.

- **DAC**

  Digital Analog Converter

- **DAMA**

  Demand Assigned Multiple Access. A channel access process for Packet-Radio where each station using the digipeater, the DAMA master, will be prompted definitely to transmit.

- **DSP**

  Digital Signal Processor or Digital Signal Processing

- **FEC**

  Forward Error Correction. Test pattern are added to the real information or the information is transmitted multiple. Because of this the receiver has the possibility to notice and correct transmission errors without transmitting the information again.

- **FIR**

- Finite impulse response. Digital filter with finite impulse response.

- **Firmware**

- Firmware offering necessary functions to the user, e.g. PACTOR, AMTOR, RTTY, etc. including command interpreter and multitasking. Therefore often new improved and enlarged versions are available.

- **FLASH**

  Special type of ROM, which can be programmed new within the circuit.

- **FlexNet**

  Software concept for digipeater which usually runs with the RMNC hardware. A time ago the FlexNet packet was transferred onto the PC hardware using the name PC-FlexNet. Further information about FlexNet and PC-FlexNet are available via Internet

- **FSK**

  Frequency Shift Keying

- **GPS**

  Global Positioning System

- **Hot-key**

  The hot-key is a key or a key combination a reaction of the system follows immediately.

- **Idle**

  Transmission of idle characters to keep the connection alive.

- **ISI**

  Inter Symbol Interference. Interference of information symbols caused by distortions at the channel.

- **ISR**

  Information Receiving Station. The current information receiver.

- **ISS**

  Information Sending Station. The current information transceiver.

- **NRZ**

  Non Return to Zero.

- **NRZI**

  Non Return to Zero Inverse.

- **Prompt**

  The input request. The prompt indicates the readiness of the system to receive commands. The PTC-IIpro indicates e.g. the readiness with **cmd:**. TNCs using **TheFirmware** will display only an asterisk \* as a prompt.

- **PSK**

  Phase Shift Keying

- **RAM**

  Random Access memory

- **RMNC**

  The short expression for Rhein-Main-Network-Controller. A special hardware especially developed for the use as a digipeater.

- **ROM**

  Read Only Memory. In the **SCS** P4dragon DR-7800 a special form of the ROM is used, the so called FLASH-memory.

- **RS232**

  Standard for the transmission of serial data. Defines the pin-out of the connectors and the voltage levels.

- **RS232 level**

  The voltage level of a serial interface in accordance with RS232 standard is defined as follows: -3 to –15 V for a logical 1, and +3 to +15 V for a logical 0. The range between –3 V and +3 V is not defined.

- **RTTY**

  **R**adio **T**ele **TY**pe.

- **Rx**

  Receive. Short name for receive.

- **RxD**

  Receive data. Short name for receiving data.

- **SNR**

  Signal Noise Ratio.

- **TAPR**

  Short name for the Tucson Amateur Packet-Radio Corporation located in Tucson/Arizona (USA). The TAPR group was most responsible for the outline for the AX.25 protocol for Packet-Radio and developed the first TNC (about 1983) and the following standards like TNC2 (about 1985). Further information about TAPR are available via Internet:

- **Terminal**

  Simple input/output device of the early beginning of the computer area. A terminal offers a serial interface, a screen and a keyboard. All signals received by the serial interface are displayed on the screen. All inputs made at the keyboard are transmitted via the serial interface.

- **TTL**

  Transistor Transistor Logic. Integrated circuits completely built up using transistors.

- **TTL-level**

  Logic level used in TTL circuits. Usually 0V for a logical 0 (low), and +5 V for a logical 1 (high) are used.

- **Tx**

  Short name for transmit.

- **TxD**

  Short name for transmit data.

- **Version number**

  Each *item* has its on version number. The Bootloader, the Firmware, SCSterm, P4Config, the manual and the other system utilities. Perhaps you will ask why, because you are confused about the many version numbers. But it is easy to understand: Without this numbers how would it be possible to differentiate between old and new versions of the single parts?
